Ethics and Professionalism\n\nProfession\nA profession is an occupational community that has specific education, expert knowledge, and a framework of practice and behavior that underpins community trust, respect, and recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstateDiagram-v2\n    direction LR\n    Profession --&gt; Clients: Establish Trust\n    Clients --&gt; Profession: Credible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Professions Establish Trust?\n\nProfessions normalize practitioner behavior by developing professional codes and standards.\nProfessions provide a service to society.\nProfessions are client focused: The major objective of codes and standards is to ensure that professionals always act in the best interest of the client and exercise a reasonable level of care, skill, and diligence with regard to providing them service.\nProfessions have high entry standards.\nAll members of a profession possess a body of expert knowledge.\nProfessions encourage and facilitate continuing education.\nProfessions monitor professional conduct to maintain integrity and reputation of an industry.\nProfessions are collegial and respect the rights, dignity, and autonomy of others.\nProfessions are recognized oversight bodies.\nProfessions encourage the engagement of members to develop expertise and ethics and to advance the profession.\n\n\n\nProfessions Are Evolving\n\nProfessions evolve over time as the requirements, technology, and standards change.\n\n\n\nProfessionalism in Investment Management\n\nMost countries require investment professionals to have some form of certification or licensing to practice. Due to regulatory coordination across borders and the emergence of technology, the investment management profession has become increasingly global.\n\n\n\nTrust in Investment Management\n\nTrust is a very important aspect in investment management. When market participants trust investment management professionals, it leads to smooth functioning and efficient capital markets, which in turn helps in the development of the economy.\n\n\n\nCFA Institute as an Investment Management Professional Body\n\nCFA Institute is the largest body for investment management professionals.\nThe mission of CFA Institute is “to lead the investment profession globally, by promoting the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society”.\nCFA Institute candidates and charterholders are required to meet the highest standards among those established by CFA Institute, regulators, or the employer.\nThe CFA Institute Code and Standards aims at aligning the interests of firms and clients.\nCFA charterholders and CFA Program candidates are required to “adhere to the Code and Standards and to annually sign a statement attesting to that continued adherence”. Charterholders and candidates must “maintain and improve their professional competence and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other investment professionals”.\n\n\nExample 2: Ethics and Professionalism\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate? Investment professionals have a special responsibility to act ethically because:\n\n\nthe industry is heavily regulated.\nthey are entrusted to protect clients’ assets.\nthe profession requires compliance with its code of ethics.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nB is correct. Investment professionals have a special responsibility because clients entrust them to protect the clients’ assets.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements best completes the following sentence? Professionals use their specialized knowledge and skills:\n\n\nin service to others.\nto advance their career.\nfor the exclusive benefit of their employers.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nA is correct. Professionals use specialized knowledge and skills in service to others. Their career and employer may benefit, but those results are not the primary focus of a professional’s use of his or her specialized knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate? A profession’s code of ethics:\n\n\nincludes standards of conduct or specific benchmarks for behavior.\nensures that all members of a profession will act ethically at all times.\npublicly communicates the shared principles and expected behaviors of a profession’s members.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. A profession’s code of ethics publicly communicates the shared principles and expected behaviors of a profession’s members. The existence of a code of ethics does not ensure that all members will behave in a manner consistent with the code and act ethically at all times. A profession will often establish a disciplinary process to address alleged violations of the code of ethics. A profession may adopt standards of conduct to enhance and clarify the code of ethics.",

    "section": "4 CHALLENGES TO ETHICAL CONDUCT",
    "text": "4 CHALLENGES TO ETHICAL CONDUCT\nSome of the challenges to ethical conduct include the following:\n\nOverestimating one’s morality:\n\nPeople often believe they are more ethical than they actually are. This overconfidence can sometimes lead to faulty decision-making. It is often seen that emotions cloud rational thinking, prompting one to make decisions that may not be the most ethical choice.\n\nSituational influences:\n\nThese are external factors such as cultural, social, and environmental factors that influence one’s thinking, behavior, and decision-making.\nSome of the common situational influences are:\n\nMoney and prestige: Both money and prestige push people to act in their own self-interests and take actions that are less ethical. The promise of a large financial bonus or a promotion, can impact people’s thinking ability and cause them to act in their own short-term interests and ignore the long-term consequences of their actions.\nLoyalty to employer, employee, and colleagues: Loyalty can have both positive and negative effects. For instance, some colleagues may encourage you to behave more ethically and enroll in the CFA Program to advance your career. On the other hand, colleagues who do not adhere to the Code and Standards may encourage you to simply act in accordance with the local law, even though it may fall short of ethical conduct.\nCompliance culture: A strong compliance policy is important for ethical decision-making. However, processes focused solely on compliance, oversimplify decision-making and do not help the larger cause. Employees may adopt a “check the box” mentality and think in terms of “What can I do?” instead of “What should I do?”\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Challenges to Ethical Conduct\n\nWhich of the following will most likely determine whether an individual will behave unethically?\n\n\nThe person’s character\nThe person’s internal traits and intrinsic motivation\nExternal factors, such as environmental or cultural elements\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. Social psychologists have shown that even good people may behave unethically in difficult situations. Situational influences, which are external factors (e.g., environmental or cultural elements), can shape our thinking, decision making, and behavior and are more likely to lead to un- ethical behavior than internal traits or character.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate?\n\n\nLarge financial rewards, such as bonuses, are the most powerful situa- tional influences.\nWhen decision making focuses on short-term factors, the likelihood of ethical conduct increases.\nSituational influences can motivate individuals to act in their short- term self-interests without recognizing the long-term risks or conse- quences for themselves and others.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. Situational influences can motivate individuals to act in their short-term self-interests without recognizing the long-term risks or con- sequences for themselves and others. Large financial rewards are powerful situational influences, but in some situations, other situational influences, such as loyalty to colleagues, may be even more powerful.",

Ethical vs. Legal Standards\nThe Overlap: Law as Codified Ethics\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nMany times, there is a grey area between what is legally accepted and what is ethical. Acting in accordance with the law and acting ethically are not necessarily the same.\nThere are four possible outcomes for any action from a legal and ethical perspective:\n\nNot legal and not ethical.\nLegal and ethical.\nNot legal but ethical:\n\nFor example, civil disobedience or protesting peacefully against an issue may not be legal, but it is ethical.\nAnother example of an illegal but ethical act is that of whistleblowing (Whistleblowing is raising the curtain off an illegal or corrupt activity).\n\nLegal but not ethical:\n\nSome countries do not have laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. While this act of trading is legal from the local country’s perspective, it is considered unethical by the CFA Institute and other investment professionals.\n\n\nThere are several reasons why laws are not sufficient to ensure ethical conduct among market participants:\n\nLaws and regulations are often created in response to existing market practices.\n\nA new law might address an existing ethical problem but create an opportunity for other unethical behavior in future.\n\nLaws can be interpreted differently.\n\nMarket participants may choose to interpret the law to their advantage or delay compliance where there is no punitive action.\n\nLaws can vary across jurisdictions.\n\nThis may encourage questionable practice to move to places that are less restrictive in nature.\n\n\nEthical conduct encourages us to:\n\nGo beyond what is legally required.\nConsider the impact on all stakeholders.\nMake good choices, even in the absence of clear laws and regulations.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4: Ethical vs. Legal Standards\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate?\n\n\nAll legal behavior is ethical behavior.\nSome ethical behavior may be illegal.\nLegal standards represent the highest standard\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nB is correct. Some ethical behavior may be illegal. Civil disobedience is an example of what may be illegal behavior that some consider to be ethical.Legal and ethical behavior often coincide but not always. Standards of conduct based on ethical principles may represent a higher standard of behavior than the behavior required by law.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate?\n\n\nIncreased regulations are the most useful means to reduce unethical behavior by market participants.\nRegulators quickly design and implement laws and regulations to address practices that adversely affect the fairness and efficiency of markets.\nNew laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that adversely affects the markets can create opportunities for different, but similarly problematic, conduct.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. New laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that adversely affects the markets can create opportunities for different, but similarly problematic, conduct.",

    "text": "6. Ethical Decision-Making Framework\nFirms must strive to develop a strong ethical culture and encourage investment professionals to apply ethical decision-making skills every day; so much so that it becomes second nature. Working and operating in an environment that fosters integrity and accountability motivates its employees to do the right thing will go a long way in preventing unethical actions.\nSetting up an ethical framework:\n\nHelps in evaluating a situation from multiple perspectives after considering the larger picture in such a way that it benefits stakeholders in the long term. Often, the impact of a decision or all aspects of a situation is not clear in the short term and decisions taken in haste may harm stakeholders unintentionally.\nHelps decision makers justify actions to a broader group of stakeholders.\n\nThe following ethical decision-making framework is presented in the curriculum.\n\nIdentification phase: Identify all the relevant facts and distinguish between facts and personal opinion, judgements, and biases. This includes information one has and what one would like to have.\n\nIdentify relevant facts such as details of the employer, information on an IPO or a deal, rules and regulations of the industry, etc.\nIdentify the stakeholders such as employer, market participants, clients, supervisor, investors, family, etc.\nIdentify relevant ethical principles for the situation. This may include loyalty to employer, clients’ interests taking precedence before everything else, and maintaining the confidentiality of information etc.\nIdentify any potential conflicts of interest, or conflicts in your duties to employers/clients.\n\nExamples of potential conflict of interest include duties to one client versus other clients of the firm, financial rewards linked to the success of a deal versus duty to employer, and duty to supervisor versus the need to impress.\n\n\nConsideration phase: Seek guidance (preferably from someone outside the firm) to navigate through situational influences and personal biases that may affect decision-making.\n\nExamples of situational influences include how much fees the firm will earn from a deal, how much bonus or compensation one expects to receive because of working on an IPO/deal, or associating one’s self-worth to working on a prestigious account/deal.\nExamples of where one could seek guidance include the firm’s compliance department, peers, the CFA Institute Code and Standards, or a supervisor.\n\nDecide and act: Make a decision and act.\nReflect: Once the decision is made, assess the decision to see if it had the desired outcome. If not, then analyze the reasons: were the stakeholders identified, was there any conflict of interest, were the ethical principles identified, did you seek guidance on how to deal with situational influences and personal behavioral biases?\n\n\nSometimes the information gathered is not sufficient to make a decision, in which case the process becomes iterative and you may seek additional guidance on how to gather more relevant information.\n\n\nApplying the Framework\n\nEXAMPLE 5: Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Framework I\nYou have been hired as a junior analyst with a major investment bank. When you join the bank, you receive a copy of the firm’s policies as well as training on the policies. Your supervisor is the senior technology analyst for the investment bank. As part of your duties, you gather information, draft documents, conduct analysis, and perform other support functions for the senior analyst.\nYour employer is one of several investment banks working on the initial public offering (IPO) of a well-known technology company. The IPO is expected to generate significant revenues for the investment banks participating in the offering. The IPO has been highly anticipated and is in the news every day.\nYou are thrilled when your supervisor asks you to work on several research projects related to analyzing and valuing the upcoming IPO for investors. You eagerly compile information and draft a one-page outline. You stop to consider what other information you could add to improve the report before proceeding. You realize that you have two excellent contacts in the technology industry who could review your work and provide some additional and potentially valuable perspectives. You draft an email to your contacts reading:\n\nI am working on an analysis and valuation of Big Tech Company for investors. My employer is one of the banks participating in the IPO, and I want to make sure I have considered everything. I was hoping you could give me feedback on the prospects and risks facing Big Tech. Please treat all the attached material as confidential.\n\nBefore hitting the send button, you stop and think about the ethical decision-making framework you have studied. You decide to apply the framework and jot down some notes as you work through the process: On the first page, you work through the identification phase and make a list of the relevant facts, stakeholders to whom you owe a duty, potential conflicts of interest, and ethical principles. This list is shown is Exhibit 3.\n\nExhibit 3: Identification Phase\n\nRelevant facts:\n\nWorking on the deal/IPO of the decade\nEmployer is one of several investment banks working on IPO\nThe IPO is highly anticipated\nA successful IPO could lead to additional investment banking deals and revenues for the firm\nSupervisor is relying on me\nEmployer has documented policies and procedures\nIndustry is regulated, with many rules and regulations in place\n\nStakeholders and duties owed. I have a duty to the following:\n\nSupervisor\nEmployer\nEmployer’s corporate client, the technology company\nEmployer’s asset management and other investing clients\nEmployer’s partners in the IPO\nInvestors and market participants interested in the IPO\nAll capital market participants\nProfession\nSociety as a whole\n\nConflicts or potential conflicts of interest include the following:\n\nGathering additional research from external sources versus maintaining confidentiality\nDuty to supervisor versus desire to impress\nDuty to corporate client versus duty to other clients of the firm\nThe firm’s corporate client benefits from a high IPO price whereas the firm’s asset management clients would benefit from a low IPO price\nMaking the IPO look attractive to the market (sell-side marketing) versus objective analysis of the investment potential of this deal (buy-side analysis)\nMy bonus, compensation, and career prospects are tied to my supervisor’s and the IPO’s success; duty to employer, employer’s investing clients, profession\n\nEthical principles that are relevant to this situation include the following:\n\nDuty of loyalty to employer\nClient interests come first\nMaintain confidences and confidentiality of information\nObjectivity of analysis\nFairness to market participants\n\n\n\nOn the next page, you write notes relating to the second phase of the framework, considering the various situational factors and the guidance available to you before considering alternative actions. These notes are shown in Exhibit 4.\n\nExhibit 4: Consideration Phase\n\nSituational influences:\n\nThe firm’s written policies\nThe bank will earn big fees from the IPO\nI want to impress my boss—and potential future bosses\nMy bonus, compensation, and career prospects will be influenced by my contribution to the success of this deal and other deals\nI am one of very few people working on this deal; it is a real honor, and others would be impressed that I am working on this deal\nMy employer is filled with successful and wealthy people who are go-getters; I want to be successful and wealthy like them\n\nAdditional guidance. I could seek guidance from the following:\n\nThe firm’s code of ethics\nThe firm’s written policies\nA peer in my firm\nMy supervisor, the senior analyst\nThe compliance department\nA mentor either at the firm or perhaps from university or industry\nThe CFA Institute Code and Standards\nOutside legal counsel\n\nAlternative actions. I could consider the following:\n\nAsking contacts what they have heard\nSubmitting the report as a draft and suggesting that contacts in the industry might be able to provide more perspective\nSending a survey to various technology industry veterans soliciting their viewpoints on developments\n\n\n\nAfter completing these steps, you decide to check the firm’s policies. Under a section entitled “Research Analyst Role in Securities Offerings,” the manual states, “You may not distribute any written (which include email, fax, electronic, and other means) material related to companies and/or their offerings . . . during the course of any offering and the related quiet period.”\nYou read further and note a section entitled “Wall Crossing Policy and Procedures” that states that “employees with confidential information may not communicate the information to anyone who does not have a valid need to know” without first obtaining clearance from the legal and compliance department.\nYou decide that your contacts do not have a “valid need to know” and that it is unlikely the firm’s legal and compliance professionals would approve sharing the information. You then decide to mention your contacts to the senior research analyst. He suggests that they may have some useful perspective and that you might talk to them to hear their perspective and cautions you not to disclose any information about any of the firm’s clients, pending deals, or research. You return to your desk, delete the email, and following the senior research analyst’s advice, call your contacts on the telephone to discuss the technology sector, its prospects, and its challenges. During the calls, you take care not to reveal any details about Big Tech Company or its offering.\nWhatever action you take, you should take time afterward to reflect on the decision and the outcome. Was the outcome as anticipated? Why or why not?\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6: Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Framework II\nA financial adviser has been saving a portion of his salary to purchase a new vehicle. He is on track to have enough saved within the next three months. His employer has offered a special bonus for this quarter, which will go to the team that attracts the most new investors into the firm’s investment funds. In addition to the potential bonus, the firm pays a 5% commission to employees who sell shares in the firm’s investment funds. Several of the funds are highly rated, including one designed to provide steady income to investors.\nThe financial adviser has added only a few new investors to the firm’s funds, but his teammates have been very successful in their efforts. The end of the quarter is one week away, and his team is competing closely with another team for the bonus. One of his teammates informs the financial adviser that he really needs the bonus so his elderly mother can receive medical treatment.\nLater that day, the financial adviser meets with an elderly client on a limited income who is seeking more income from his investment portfolio. The client is 89 years old and in poor health. According to the client’s will, the client’s investment portfolio will go to his favorite charity upon his death.\n\n\nWhich of the following situational influences is likely to have the most effect on the financial adviser’s efforts to get new clients to invest in the funds? His relationship with his:\n\n\nclient.\nemployer.\nteammates.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. The financial adviser’s relationship with his teammates is likely to have the most effect on the financial adviser’s efforts. The teammates share in earning the bonus from the employer. In addition, the team works with each other on a regular basis where there is a likelihood that social influences of working together play a role in decision making and effort.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate? An ethical decision-making framework:\n\n\nis only beneficial when a firm lacks a code of ethics.\nis used to improve compliance with laws and regulations.\nis a tool for analyzing the potential alternative actions and consequences of a decision.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. An ethical decision-making framework is a tool for analyzing the potential alternative actions and consequences of a decision.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is most accurate? Ethical decision-making frameworks:\n\n\nraise awareness of different perspectives.\nfocus attention on short-term consequences.\nallocate more weight to those who will directly benefit from the decision.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nA is correct. Ethical decision-making frameworks raise awareness of different perspectives. The framework should consider short-term consequences, but they are not the focus of the framework. Similarly, the framework may allocate more weight to those who directly benefit from decisions, but this is not the primary goal of an ethical decision-making framework.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is most accurate? Ethical decision-making frameworks:\n\n\nare not needed if behavior is legal.\nidentify who gains the most from a decision.\ncan help reduce unanticipated ethical lapses and unexpected consequences.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. Ethical decision-making frameworks can help avoid unanticipated ethical consequences. As it relates to A, ethics standards are often higher than legal standards so an ethical decision-making framework would be needed. Although B is accurate, identifying who gains most from the decision is a small component of the framework.\n\n\n\nUsing an ethical decision-making framework, which of the following duties would most likely take precedence in the scenario described? The financial adviser’s duty to his:\n\n\nclient.\nemployer.\ncolleagues.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nA is correct. Using an ethical decision-making framework, the financial adviser’s relationship with his client would most likely take precedence in this scenario. The adviser should put his client’s interests first. The exception to client interests taking precedence occurs when market integrity effects take precedence.\n\n\n\nUsing an ethical decision-making framework, the financial adviser would most likely:\n\n\nrecommend that the elderly client invest at least some of his assets in the highly rated fund.\nresearch other investments that can provide steady income before making a recommendation to his elderly client.\ndisclose the commission he would earn before recommending that the elderly client invest at least some of his assets in the highly rated fund.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nB is correct. Using an ethical decision-making framework, the financial adviser would identify the relevant facts, stakeholders, duties owed, and potential conflicts. In this scenario, the financial adviser owes a duty to his client as well as his employer. His client’s interests take precedence over all other interests. The bonus and his colleague’s desire to help his mother are situational influences. To navigate this situation, the financial adviser should seek additional information; he should research the risk and return parameters and fee structures of other investments that can provide steady income before making a recommendation to his client.",

    "text": "7. Conclusion\n\nSummary\n\nLO: Explain ethics.\nThe word ethics is derived from the Greek word ethos, which means character. Ethics means making good choices. Ethics includes a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that help us in our behavior.\n\n\nLO: Describe the role of a code of ethics in defining a profession.\nA profession is an occupational community having specialized knowledge and skills; which adheres to ethical behavior; and is subject to some combination of licensed status and technical standards\nA profession is different from craft guilds and trade bodies in two ways, i.e. unlike trade bodies, members of professions are required to uphold high ethical standards and their mission is to serve society.\n\n\nLO: Describe professions and how they establish trust.\n\n\nLO: Explain professionalism in investment management.\nThe common characteristics that help establishing the confidence and credibility in professionals and their organizations include the following:\n\nProfessions normalize practitioner behavior;\nProfessions provide a service to society;\nProfessions have high entry standards;\nAll members of a profession possess a body of expert knowledge;\nProfessions encourage and facilitate continuing education;\nProfessions monitor professional conduct to maintain integrity and reputation of an industry;\nProfessions are collegial and respect the rights, dignity, and autonomy of others;\nProfessions are recognized oversight bodies;\nProfessions encourage the engagement of members;\n\n\nProfessions evolve over time as the requirements, technology, and standards change.\nTrust is the key in investment management and the trust is established by acting with care, due diligence, and judgment for clients.\n\n\n\nLO: Describe the need for high ethical standards in investment management.\nInvestment management profession combined with ethical corporate governance plays a vital role in the growth and development of the capital market. When market participants have trust in the investment management professionals, it leads to efficient capital market and smooth functioning which in turn helps in the development of the economy.\n\n\nLO: Identify challenges to ethical behavior.\nSome of the challenges to ethical conduct include the following:\n\nOverestimating one’s morality: People believe they are more ethical than they actually are. This overconfidence in themselves can sometimes lead to faulty decision-making.\nSituational influences: These are external factors such as cultural, social, and environmental factors that influence one’s thinking, behavior, and decision-making. Some of the common situational influences are:\n\nMoney and prestige\nLoyalty to employer, employee, and colleagues\nCompliance culture\n\n\n\n\nLO: Compare and contrast ethical standards with legal standards.\nLegal and ethical conduct is not always the same.\nLaws are not always the best mechanism to reduce unethical behavior because:\n\nLegal standards are often created to address past ethical failings. They do not provide\ndirection for an ever changing and increasingly complex world.\nLaws are often rule-based.\nLaws will vary across countries.\n\nEthical conduct goes beyond legal standards.\n\n\nLO: Describe and apply a framework for ethical decision-making.\nA framework for ethical decision-making can help people look at and assess a decision from different perspectives. This enables them to make good decisions, and to limit unplanned consequences.\nA general ethical decision-making framework has the following four steps.\n\nIdentify: Relevant facts, stakeholders and duties owed, ethical principles, conflicts of interest.\nConsider: Situational influences, additional guidance, alternative actions.\nDecide and act.\nReflect: Was the outcome as anticipated? Why or why not?\n\n\nPRACTICE PROBLEMS\n\nBenchmarks for minimally acceptable behaviors of community members are:\n\n\na code of ethics.\nlaws and regulations.\nstandards of conduct.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. Standards of conduct are applied to specific communities or societal groups and identify specific behaviors required of community members. These standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community members. Codes of ethics serve as a general guide for how community members should act; they communicate the organization’s values and overall expectations regarding member behavior, but they do not identify specific behaviors required of community members. Laws and regulations are rules of conduct defined by governments and related entities about obligatory and forbidden conduct broadly applicable for individuals and entities under their jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nSpecialized knowledge and skills, a commitment to serve others, and a shared code of ethics best characterize a(n):\n\n\nvocation.\nprofession.\noccupation.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nB is correct. A profession has several characteristics that distinguish it from an occupation or vocation, such as specialized knowledge and skills, service to others, and a code of ethics shared by its members. A profession is the ultimate evolution of an occupation, resulting from excellence in practice, a mastery mindest, and expected adherence to a code of ethics and standards of practice.\n\n\n\nWhen unethical behavior erodes trust in an investment firm, that firm is more likely to experience:\n\n\nlower revenues only.\nhigher expenses only.\nlower revenues and higher expenses.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. Unethical behavior ultimately harms investment firms. Clients are not attracted if they suspect unethical behavior, leading to less business and lower revenues. Investment firms may also experience higher relative costs because regulators are more likely to have cause to initiate costly investigations.\n\n\n\nHigh ethical standards are distinguishing features of which of the following bodies?\n\n\nCraft guilds\nTrade bodies\nProfessional bodies\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. High ethical standards distinguish professions from the craft guilds or trade bodies. Unlike trade bodies, professional bodies also typically have a mission to serve society and enforce professional conduct rules for practitioners.\n\n\n\nFiduciary duty is a standard most likely to be upheld by members of a(n):\n\n\nemployer.\nprofession.\nnot-for-profit body.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nB is correct. Fiduciary duty is an obligation to deliver a high standard of care when acting for the benefit of another party. Professionals must act in the best interest of the client, exercising a reasonable level of care, skill, and diligence. Other entities—including employers, regulators, trade associations, and not-for-profit bodies—may also support an industry but are not the same as professional bodies. Unlike professions, these other entities generally do not exist to set and maintain professional standards.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following best identifies an internal trait that may lead to poor ethical decision making?\n\n\nOverconfidence\nLoyalty to employer\nPromise of money or prestige\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nA is correct. An overconfidence bias can lead individuals to put too much importance on internal traits and intrinsic motivations, such as their own perceptions of personal honesty, that can lead to faulty decision making. Loyalty to an employer and promise of money or prestige are situational influences that can lead to faulty decision making.\n\n\n\nSituational influences in decision making will most likely be minimized if:\n\n\nstrong compliance programs are in place.\nlonger-term consequences are considered.\nindividuals believe they are truthful and honest.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nB is correct. Consciously considering long-term consequences will help offset situational influences. We more easily recognize and consider short-term situational influences than longer-term considerations because longer-term considerations have fewer immediate consequences than situational influences do. When decision making is too narrowly focused on short-term factors, we tend to ignore longer-term risks and consequences, and the likelihood of poor ethical decision making increases. A strong compliance policy is a good first step toward developing an ethical culture; a focus on rules adherence may not be sufficient. Emphasison compliance may not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture and can oversimplify decision making. Taken to the extreme, a strong compliance culture can become another situational influence that blinds employees to other important considerations. An overconfidence bias can place too much importance on internal traits and intrinsic motivations, such as “I’m honest and would not lie,” even though studies have shown that internal traits are generally not the main determinant of whether or not someone will behave ethically in a given situation.\n\n\n\nDecision makers who use a compliance approach are most likely to:\n\n\navoid situational influences.\noversimplify decision making.\nconsider more factors than when using an ethical decision-making approach.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nB is correct. A compliance approach can oversimplify decision making and may not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture. A strong compliance culture may be a good start in developing an ethical culture but can become another situational influence that may result in employees failing to consider other important factors.\n\n\n\nTo maintain trust, the investment management profession must be interdependent with:\n\n\nregulators.\nemployers.\ninvestment firms.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. The investment management profession and investment firms must be interdependent to maintain trust. Employers and regulators have their own standards and practices, which may differ from regulations and standards set by professional bodies.\n\n\n\nWhich is an example of an activity that may be legal but that CFA Institute considers unethical?\n\n\nMaking legally required disclosures in marketing materials\nTrading while in possession of material nonpublic information\nDisclosure by an employee of his or her own company’s dishonest activity\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nB is correct. The investment industry has examples of conduct that may be legal but that CFA Institute considers unethical. Trading while in possession of material nonpublic information is not prohibited by law worldwide and can, therefore, be legal, but CFA Institute considers such trading unethical.\n\n\n\nAn ethical decision-making framework will most likely:\n\n\ninclude a pre-determined, uniform sequence.\nfocus exclusively on confirmable facts and relationships.\nhelp avoid a decision that has unanticipated ethical consequences.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. Using an ethical decision-making framework consistently will help you develop sound judgment and decision-making skills and avoid making decisions that have unanticipated ethical consequences. The decision-making process is often iterative, and the decision maker may move between phases of the framework. A decision maker should consider more than confirmable facts and relationships; for example, the decision maker should consider situational influences and personal biases.\n\n\n\nWhen an ethical dilemma occurs, an investment professional should most likely first raise the issue with a:\n\n\nmentor outside the firm.\nprofessional body’s hotline.\nsenior individual in the firm.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. When a dilemma occurs, raising an issue internally with a senior employee is often a good starting place and creates an opportunity for an independent internal review. Protecting the client and the firm may take priority over the position of an individual professional raising a concern.",
