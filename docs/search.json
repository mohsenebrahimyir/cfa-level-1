Ethics can be described as a set of moral principles that provide guidance for our behavior; these may be moral principles shared by a community or societal group.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate? Standards of conduct:\n\nare a necessary component of any code of ethics.\nserve as a general guide regarding proper conduct by members of a group.\nserve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior required of members of a group.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\nC is correct. Standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior required of members of a group. Some organizations will adopt only a code of ethics, which communicates the organization’s values and overall expectations regarding member behavior. Others may adopt both a code of ethics and standards of conduct. Standards of conduct identify specific behavior required of community members and serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community members.",
